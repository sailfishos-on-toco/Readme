This org contains all sources to build Sailfish OS for Mi Note 10 Lite

# Installing
Installing requires unlocking your device and installing [TWRP](https://twrp.me/xiaomi/xiaomimi10lite.html).
Your device will probably be out of warranty.

You need MIUI Android 10 vendor partition.
You can use [toco_eea_global_images_V12.0.2.0.QFNEUXM_20201026.0000.00_10.0_eea](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/miui/toco/stable/V12.0.2.0.QFNEUXM/) or [miui_TOCOEEAGlobal_V12.0.2.0.QFNEUXM_763475e07c_10.0.zip](https://xiaomirom.com/en/download/mi-note-10-lite-toco-stable-V12.0.2.0.QFNEUXM/) (recommended).

Both of the Xiaomi firmwares above will replace TWRP - but the latter will allow you to replace it back without reverting it at each boot.
